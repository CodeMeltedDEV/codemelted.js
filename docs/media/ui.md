<mark>Brief introduction to the feature being requested. Could be from a Jira board, assigned problem report, customer request, or the start of a bigger project. This focuses mainly functionality of a singular request and may serve as a bigger piece of a whole.</mark>

# FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS



## UC-1: Function Feature

<mark>IF Describing via Behavioral Driven Development (BDD) User Story Format</mark>

- **Description:** As a [who], I want [what], so that [why].
- **Scenario 1:** Describe the scenario
    - *Given:* Sets up the initial context, state, or preconditions of the system before any action happens.
    - *When:* Describes the specific action, event, or trigger performed by the user or system.
    - *Then:* Specifies the expected observable outcome or response after the action.
    - *And:* Extends any of the previous statements to add positive or multiple conditions, actions, or results.
    - *But:* Adds a negative condition, exception, or contrasting limitation to the preceding steps
- **Scenario 2:** Describe the scenario
    - *Given:* Sets up the initial context, state, or preconditions of the system before any action happens.
    - *When:* Describes the specific action, event, or trigger performed by the user or system.
    - *Then:* Specifies the expected observable outcome or response after the action.
    - *And:* Extends any of the previous statements to add positive or multiple conditions, actions, or results.
    - *But:* Adds a negative condition, exception, or contrasting limitation to the preceding steps

<mark>IF Describing via Use Case Scenario Format:</mark>

- **Description:** A description of what this use case is all about.
- **Actors:** Who / what is triggering this use case.
- **Trigger:** The ideal setup necessary for the use case scenario to run.
- **Main Success Scenario:** The primary, ideal sequence of steps where everything goes right and the user achieves their goal without errors
- **Alternate Flows:** Different paths or optional behaviors that still lead to success (e.g., a customer pays with PayPal instead of a credit card)
- **Exception Flows:** Paths handling errors, invalid inputs, or system failures (e.g., a declined credit card or an out-of-stock item)
- **Post-Condition:** The expectation when the main success scenario completes.

<mark>IF Describing via EARS Function Requirements Format:</mark>

- Ubiquitous (Always Active): The <system name> shall <system response> (e.g., The mobile phone shall have a mass of less than 150 grams
- State-Driven (Active During a State): While <state>, the <system name> shall <system response> (e.g., While the vehicle is in reverse, the system shall display the rear camera feed)
- Event-Driven (Triggered by an Event): When <trigger>, the <system name> shall <system response> (e.g., When the user presses the power button, the device shall turn on)
- Optional Features: Where <feature is present>, the <system name> shall <system response> (e.g., Where the navigation package is installed, the system shall display the map)
- Unwanted Behavior: If <unwanted trigger>, then the <system name> shall <system response> (e.g., If the password is entered incorrectly three times, then the system shall lock the account)
