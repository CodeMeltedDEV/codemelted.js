# CODE

The following are starter coding templates that either conform to the given languages SDK documentation tool or just has a comments section for good maintenance purposes.

## CSS Styles

CSS styles serve as the basis for styling an HTML webpage. It can create a rich User Interface experience to aid in developing either static website, Single Page Application (SPA), or a Progressive Web Application (PWA) taking full advantage of a near native experience without the hassle of an app store. The organization below is a guide in grouping your CSS in a way that allows for easy maintenance and overrides to flow appropriately.

## JavaScript / TypeScript Module

Any complicated JavaScript full-stack solution should utilize ES6 modules. This allows for segmenting code into organized chunks. The below template is validated via `typedoc` which universally makes the nicest documentation between the different JavaScript V8 runtimes and web pages alike. Extra information is stored within this example to allow for one-off module management. For larger projects, this additional information would be unnecessary. The `// @ts-check` at the top of the module is key for utilizing modern type checking within major code editors and linters.

```javascript
// @ts-check

## Linux / Unix Shell Script

Every now and again you will need to build quick utilities in a terminal shell. The example below gives the ability to manage such a script whether it is a personal tool chain or represents a bigger DevOps solution. No individual versioning is captured but keeping a version history and to-do section is handy when you are individually managing the script, but it does not exist in source control repository.

```sh

}
main $@
```

## PowerShell Script

Same as the [Linux / Unit Shell Script](#linux--unix-shell-script) a Windows terminal shell offers PowerShell. Unlike traditional Linux / Unix shells utilize POSIX rules for passing strings, PowerShell offers Object parsing utilizing .NET core. What is even more powerful, is that PowerShell core can run on Linux / Unix shells as well-meaning you can create a cross-platform shell script.

It has all the modern programming language niceties wrapped into a shell environment. Its help system is fully integrated into the environment with the ability to build distributable modules or scripts via the PowerShell Gallery. To that end however, most users are just creating simple scripts to the example below follows the same paradigm as shell scripts with the PowerShell script. If you want to develop more complicated, scripts, visit PowerShell Learn for examples of organizing such scripts.

```PowerShell

# MARKDOWN

With AI becoming a powerful tool within a software engineer's arsenal, it is important to apply sound software engineering principles to aid in what you are building. You should control the AI tool, not the other way around. The templates below serve different aspects of software engineering techniques whether utilizing AI or not.

Each of the markdown templates have a YAML header to support webpage generation via different tools. It is then proceeded with HTML `<center></center>` that has an optional `<img />` tag for a header image along with a `<h1></h1>` tag for a title. Finally, it is proceeded with a `**Table of Contents**` section for the breakdown of what is contained as sections. From there each template will identify the markdown header sections along with `<mark></mark>` tags explaining what information is utilized within the template.

## Feature Request

Before becoming a full-fledged software engineer, you will start a job working Jira tickets or analyzing Discrepancy (DR) / Problem Report (PR). In either event, when you are new to a system you have to apply Black Box / White Box techniques to determine what change you are making.

The template below provides two sections. The first is the *FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS* to allow for fleshing out exactly what is needed to make the change complete. The second section is *NOTES*. This is a free-form section to capture any design elements or test changes to validate the change. This information can either "complete" the change or serve as information into larger artifacts within your development process. Hence, its free-form nature.

# FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS

<mark>An introductory use case model or other architecture diagram that may aid in visualizing the different requirements categories below.</mark>

<mark>Add a new model for each complex Function Feature that may need further pictorial and feature breakdown until it is at its lowest testable functional description.</mark>

## UC-1: Function Feature

<mark>IF Describing via Behavioral Driven Development (BDD) User Story Format</mark>

- **Description:** As a [who], I want [what], so that [why].
- **Scenario 1:** Describe the scenario
    - *Given:* Sets up the initial context, state, or preconditions of the system before any action happens.
    - *When:* Describes the specific action, event, or trigger performed by the user or system.
    - *Then:* Specifies the expected observable outcome or response after the action.
    - *And:* Extends any of the previous statements to add positive or multiple conditions, actions, or results.
    - *But:* Adds a negative condition, exception, or contrasting limitation to the preceding steps
- **Scenario 2:** Describe the scenario
    - *Given:* Sets up the initial context, state, or preconditions of the system before any action happens.
    - *When:* Describes the specific action, event, or trigger performed by the user or system.
    - *Then:* Specifies the expected observable outcome or response after the action.
    - *And:* Extends any of the previous statements to add positive or multiple conditions, actions, or results.
    - *But:* Adds a negative condition, exception, or contrasting limitation to the preceding steps

<mark>IF Describing via Use Case Scenario Format:</mark>

- **Description:** A description of what this use case is all about.
- **Actors:** Who / what is triggering this use case.
- **Trigger:** The ideal setup necessary for the use case scenario to run.
- **Main Success Scenario:** The primary, ideal sequence of steps where everything goes right and the user achieves their goal without errors
- **Alternate Flows:** Different paths or optional behaviors that still lead to success (e.g., a customer pays with PayPal instead of a credit card)
- **Exception Flows:** Paths handling errors, invalid inputs, or system failures (e.g., a declined credit card or an out-of-stock item)
- **Post-Condition:** The expectation when the main success scenario completes.

<mark>IF Describing via EARS Function Requirements Format:</mark>

- Ubiquitous (Always Active): The <system name> shall <system response> (e.g., The mobile phone shall have a mass of less than 150 grams
- State-Driven (Active During a State): While <state>, the <system name> shall <system response> (e.g., While the vehicle is in reverse, the system shall display the rear camera feed)
- Event-Driven (Triggered by an Event): When <trigger>, the <system name> shall <system response> (e.g., When the user presses the power button, the device shall turn on)
- Optional Features: Where <feature is present>, the <system name> shall <system response> (e.g., Where the navigation package is installed, the system shall display the map)
- Unwanted Behavior: If <unwanted trigger>, then the <system name> shall <system response> (e.g., If the password is entered incorrectly three times, then the system shall lock the account)

# NOTES

<mark>Add any specific notes that will aid in the implementation and validation of the given feature request. This can include UML artifacts, examples, test demonstration, etc. to satisfy the full implementation of the feature request.</mark>
```

## Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)

From the book *Managing Software Requirements (A Use Case Approach) 2nd Ed* it provides a fully fleshed out template for performing a full Object-Oriented Analysis and Design utilizing use cases. To that end, the template has been tweaked to break out *FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS* still utilizing a use case model as the introduction, but identifies the different ways of deriving and fleshing out functional behavior of a system. From there the *NON-FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS* allows for the breakdown of all the different non-functional areas of a system usually forgotten or ignored. Finally, the *DESIGN ANALYSIS* allows for designing out the rest of the software / hardware / system boundaries to fully flesh out the design.

This template can be all encompassing or broken up into different OOAD markdown files for larger more complex systems. It is really up the software engineer in managing how this is broken up to make sense. The key is if you build it, keep in sync and up to date with the software solution you are building.

## Process

> CMMI stands for Capability Maturity Model Integration. It is a global framework designed to help businesses improve their performance, build key capabilities, and measure work processes [CMMI Institute](https://cmmiinstitute.com/cmmi/intro)

Per the *CMMI: Guidelines for Process Integration and Product Improvement (2nd Ed)*, any repeating process an organization does should be documented. The CMMI provides a framework defining levels 1 through 5 for an organizations process maturity. To that end, the template below serves a starting point for documenting these processes. It also serves as a good starting point for an AI plan to scope what the AI is to perform and how to do it.

## README

When first making a software repository for a new software component, it is good to have a `README.md` file that introduces the project. It breaks into four sections. *FEATURES* introduces what is important aspects of the project and what makes it useful. The *GETTING STARTED* identifies how you utilize the repo to be successful. Finally, the *USAGE* begins the basic usage of the repo with larger SDK documentation giving the greater context of full usage of the repo software solution.

## Test Case

A test case serves as a black-box technique for validating software systems. Usually breaking into Functional (test of system functional requirements) and Regression (non-degradation validation between releases) Test Cases. These can serve as a manual executed by human or with modern tooling, an automated test suite. In either event, this serves a good starting point for these types of tests. These also usually in larger software / system organizations, map to specific requirements in a larger traceability matrix.
